Install
git clone or download into modules directory. 
Enable module with drush or from the UI

Change the Query Settings of the Elms Media Browser View... it comes installed by default with this module.
In the query settings you will want to point to the remote xml feed. For now an example.xml file is your source. It should give you a good idea of
how the XML should be structured according to the default view. You can change the fields and exposed filters to anything that is available on your site.
Just remember to update the views in both places. 

If you want to serve images from a remote site... you will need a remote site that renders the appropriate XML. I assume that if you need this 
module you already know how to set up the remote site with the appropriate XML markup/output.

I currently am using Views Data Export to serve my data from the remote site, however, restws is starting to look pretty promising...
